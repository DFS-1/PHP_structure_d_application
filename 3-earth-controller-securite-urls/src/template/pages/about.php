            <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Tyler Moore and with the help of many people I made this template. I made it so it
                is super easy to update and so that it flows perfectly with my tutorials. Lots of love and hundreds
                of hours went into making it. I hope you love it as much as I do.<br><br>
                I wish you the best of luck with your business, enjoy the adventure.</p>
